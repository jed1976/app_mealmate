Greetings, my name is Joe Dakroub. I run a small mobile dev company called Teacup Studio (www.teacupstudio.com).

Last night, my app MealMate, went live on the iPhone App Store.

MealMate is a simple WeightWatchers points calculator designed to remove the hassle of inputting values. Rather than using text fields like all the other apps out there, MealMate uses a picker that lets you choose values with the flick of your finger. In an instant, you see the point values without having to hit a Calculate button. This reduces errors and makes it easier to hold in one hand while at the grocery store, in a restaurant, or at home.

The app supports portrait and landscape modes, with servings sizes available in landscape mode. In addition, MealMate supports orientation locking and both the US and UK points systems.

MealMate makes calculating food points effortless, intuitive, and fun!

Here is the marketing text:

With the flick of a finger, you can quickly measure the fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and protein content in your food. 

Easily assign serving sizes when in landscape mode. You can also lock the orientation to stay in landscape or portrait. 

Want to start over? Simply shake your device to reset. 

Ideal for when grocery shopping, dining out, or enjoying a snack at home. 

This app works for the US and UK*. 

*UK can be activated in the settings panel.
